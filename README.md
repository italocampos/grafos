# Graphs
This repository stores files from a personal library which models the graphs data structure. Were used two different approaches: one which models graphs under **object-oriented** view point, and other which uses the **adjacency matrix** modeling. Bellow there is a short description of each one of them.


## Oriented-object modeling

Uses the object-oriented (OO) to model the graph data structure. Vertices, edges, and even the entire graph are implemented as classes. Althougt this module has the standard graph definition with methods, this module also has a small language to read a graph from a file. See the _object_oriented_ folder to more information.


## Adjacency matrix modeling

Uses the adjacency matrices data structure to models the graphs. The `Graph` is a class that contais and handle the adjacency matrix. The input is made by classical methods and by reading a file. See the _adjacency_matrix/input_ folder to more information.


### We need your help
Fell free by contributing, forking, improving, or changing this repository. It was born to store the implementations from Grahs subject on my graduation but it is getting a recurrent use to others projects. Standardize this library may be help other people to use the graph data structure
